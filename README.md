I chose the Gta 5 game. According to the plot, there are several objects, that is, characters. Objects can move, drive a car, shoot from a machine gun. There is a character menu and each character has their own individual skills. The menu has a GPS navigator, missions to be completed, snacks, etc.  There are also bots in the game that also have their own actions. They can move freely around the map, eat food, work.
